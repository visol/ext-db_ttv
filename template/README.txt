************************************************************************************
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO EDIT THE HTML-TEMPLATES IN THIS FOLDER
************************************************************************************
All changes concerning the design, are done in the CSS-files
in folder fileadmin/
Additional DIV-containers should be added by TypoScript-code you must write.
This is the YAML Philosophy. Please follow it and you'll be much, much
happier with both YAML and your outcome...
************************************************************************************
If, for some reason, you REALLY need other HTML-Templates, then
create NEW ones in an OTHER folder and create NEW datastructures (DS) and
templateobjects (TS) within TemplaVoila.
I will add more HTML-Templates and DS and TOs in future versions of this extension.

This procedure is important, in order to be able to make Updates of this extension.
If you add own files within the extension folder or if you edit files here,
they are OVERWRITTEN and lost if you update this extension..

You WILL get error-messages in TemplaVoila if you edit the HTML-Templates.
The time stamp then changes, TYPO3 recognises this and an error message is shown.

EDIT ONLY if you really know, how to deal with that issue.
