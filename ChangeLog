* Internal release V 4.0.1 to 4.0.3
- Changed config.linkVars = L(1-6) to avoid index.php?L=0 if realURL is not used.
- Commented out additionalHeaders = Content-Type:text/html;charset=utf-8
  because this is now sent automatically.
- Changed spamProtectEmailAddresses = ascii
  This way no JavaScript is needed to decrypt email addresses.
- Added page.adminPanelStyles = 1 if admin panel is enabled.
- Set removeDefaultJS = 1 since we dont need the blur links JavaScript.
- Updated the complete package to TYPO3 4.2.2
- Applied patch for bug #9497 in TYPO3 4.2.2
  t3lib/class.t3lib_tceforms.php
  typo3/alt_palette.php
  typo3/wizard_rte.php
  Original files are still in place.

* Internal release V 4.0.0
- Renumbered object temp.buildHeaderData from 10 to 80 so that we are able to add things
  between it (e.g. the YAML debug stylesheet).
- Added an automatic generated ID for the body tag of each page to make it more simple
  to change designs for some pages.
  <body id="pageUID-xx"> could be changed with CSS: #pageUID-xx {....}
  Thanks to fazzyx for that idea.
- Changed all date formats to %A, %Y-%m-%d
  Please read http://www.saqqara.demon.co.uk/datefmt.htm
  why you should read this format in all countries.
- Made languageIsoCodeStandardLang, languageIsoCodeFirstLang, languageIsoCodeSecondLang,
  languageIsoCodeThirdLang, languageIsoCodeFourthLang, languageIsoCodeFifthLang and
  languageIsoCodeSixthLang a string instead of an option to make it possible to enter
  ANY Iso code and not just the ones the option box contained.
- Removed dependency to kb_md5fepw. Too many questions and problems with this.
  Of course encryption of passwords is still supported. Install and configure by
  yourself, if you need or want that.
  In my opinion this must go to the core of TYPO3 and be supported by ALL extensions
  by default.
- Added cron_accessiblemenus and gov_accesskey configuration to the static setup
  of the extension.
  Features can be switched on and off using constant editor (see yaml-expert-settings).
  Switched off by default.
  Configuration is added for all three menus (topnav, nav_main and submenu).
  If you switch on the feature, it is available in all three menus. See TSOB to control
  this manually.
- Removed old user_IProc_dfn script.
- Removed all translated content.
- Set english as standard language.
- Added syslanguage_flags to the list of recommended extensions.
- Removed YAML from the extension because it is not published under the GPL.
- Changed footer links and removed Dirk Jesse's name on his demand.
- Changed all copyright hints. 
- Changed state to stable.
- Removed dependency on kb_md5fepw.
- First version released under the GPL.
